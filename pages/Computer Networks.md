	- A network is a collection of devices connected to each other to allow sharing of data. #defination
- ## Types of network topology. {{cloze 6}} types
	- STAR
		- Start topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single device known as central device.
		- Start topology requires more cable. As compared to other top topologies and therefore it is more robust. Because if a single cable is failed. Then the entire network is not compromised.
		- If the central device is damaged, the whole network fails.
		- It is the easiest to install. And troubleshoot and therefore it is widely used in homes and offices.
	- RING
		- In this topology, the nodes are connected by exactly 2 nodes. And therefore they form a single continuous transmission path.
		- Ring topology does not need a central server.
		- If a single node is failed the entire network collapses.
		- Examples: sonet network, sdh network etc.
	- BUS
		- In this topology, all the nodes are connected by a single cable known as the bus.
		- If a device wants to send the data to other device then the message is transmitted to the bus.
		- If the bus is damaged, the whole network fails.
	- MESH
		- In this topology, all the nodes are individually connected to other nodes.
		- It does not need a central switch or hub.
		- 2 types:
			- Fully connected. In this topology: Every node is connected individually to every other node.
			- Partially connected: In this topology, every node is not connected to every other node
		- It is expensive to install as the cables are required in bulk.
	- TREE
		- It is the combination of star and bust topologies.
		- All the star networks are connected by a single bus.
		- If the bus is damaged, the entire network fails.
		- But if a star network is damaged, then only that segment fails.
	- HYBRID
		- As the name suggests. The hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies.
		- It provides flexibility.
- ## OSI (Open System Interconnections)
	- It is a network architecture model based on the ISO standards.
	- It is called the OSI model as it deals with connecting the systems that are open for communication with other systems.
	- ### The OSI model has seven layers.
		- A Penguin said that nobody drinks Pepsi. #mnemonic
		- Application layer.
			- Application layer enables the user to access the network.
			- Application layer protocols are file transfer protocol, simple mail transfer protocol, domain name system, etc.
			- The most widely used application protocol is HTTP (Hypertext transfer protocol ). A user sends the request for the web page using HTTP
		- Presentation layer.
			- The presentation layer is also known as translation layer as it translates the data from one format to another format.
			- At the sender side, this layer translates the data format used by the application layer to the common format and at the receiver side, this layer translates the common format into a format used by application layer.
			- Functions of presentation layer.
				- Character code translation.
				- Data conversion.
				- Data compression.
				- Data encryption.
		- Session layer.
			- The main responsibility of the session layer is beginning, maintaining and ending the communication between the devices.
			- Session layer also reports the error coming from the upper layers.
			- Session layer establishes and maintains the session between the two users.
		- Transport layer.
			- It delivers the message through the network and provides error checking so that no error occurs during the transfer of data.
			- It provides two kinds of services.
				- Connection oriented transmission.
					- In this transmission, the receiver sends the acknowledgment to the sender after the packet has been received.
				- Connectionless transmission.
					- In this transmission, the receiver does not send the acknowledgment to the sender.
		- Network layer.
		  id:: 628fcdb2-516d-437c-b95e-3701a23e94d2
			- Network layer converts the logical address into the physical address.
			- The routing concept means it determines the best route for the packet to travel from.
			- Functions of network layer.
				- Routing.
					- The network layer determines the best route from the source to destination. This function is known as routing.
				- Logical Addressing.
					- The network layer defines the addressing scheme to identify each device uniquely.
				- Packetizing.
					- The network layer receives the data from the upper layer and converts the data into packets. This process is known as packetizing.
				- Internetworking.
					- The network layer provides the logical connection between the different types of network for forming a bigger network.
				- Fragmentation.
					- It is a process of dividing the packets into fragments.
		- Datalink layer.
		  id:: 628fcdb2-e10c-4ec4-b9b0-0ee6736bd160
			- It is used for transferring the data from one node to another node.
			- It receives the data from the network layer and converts the data into data frames and then attaches the physical address to these frames which are sent to the physical layer.
			- It enables the error free transfer of data from one node to another node.
			- Functions of data link layer.
				- Frame synchronization.
					- Datalink layer converts the data into frames and it ensures that the destination must recognize the starting and ending of each frame.
				- Flow control.
					- Datalink layer controls the data flow within the network.
				- Error control.
					- It detects and corrects the error occurred during the transmission from the source to destination.
				- Addressing.
					- Datalink layer attaches the physical address with the data frame so that the individual machines can be easily identified.
				- Link management.
					- Datalink layer managers the initiation, maintenance and termination of the link between the source and destination for the effective exchange of data.
		- Physical Layer.
		  id:: 628fcdb2-8220-4446-ba41-17b8942e165c
			- It is the lowest layer of OSI reference model.
			- It is used for the transmission of an unstructured raw bitstream over a physical medium.
			- Physical layer transmits the data either in the form of electrical, optical, or mechanical form.
			- The physical layer is mainly used for the physical connection between the devices and such physical connection can be made by using twisted pair cable, fiber optic or wireless transmission media.
