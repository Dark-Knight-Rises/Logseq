- ## What is an OS? #card
	- An OS can be defined as the interface between user and hardware.
	- It is responsible for the execution of all the processes. Resource allocation, CPU management, and file management.
	- The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which the user can execute the programs in an efficient manner.
- ## Types of OS. {{cloze 5}} types
	- Batch
		- A similar set of jobs are stored in the main memory for execution.
		- A job gets assigned to the CPU only when the previous job gets completed.
	- Multiprogramming
		- The main memory consists of jobs waiting for the CPU time.
		- The OS selects one process and assigns it to the CPU.
		- Whenever the executing process needs to wait for any other operations like input or output, then the OS selects another process from the job queue and assigns it to the CPU.
		- This way the CPU never gets idle. And the user gets the illusion of getting multiple jobs done at a time.
	- Multitasking
