- [[Arrays]]
	- Arrays are called vector variables, whereas the normal variables are called the scalar variables.
	- Arrays can be of two types. The static and the dynamic array.
	- In the static array, the size of the array is known beforehand and therefore it is created inside the stack section of the memory.
	- Whereas in the dynamic array the size of the array is not known beforehand and therefore it is created in the heap section of the memory.
	- [[What I Learned]]
		- The main memory contains 3. Sections. The first is the code execution section, the second is the Stack section and the third is the heap section.
		- Program cannot access the heap memory directly.
		- Every variable that is created is created inside the stack section.
