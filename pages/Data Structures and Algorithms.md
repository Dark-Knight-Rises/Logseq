- [[Arrays]]
	- Arrays are called vector variables, whereas the normal variables are called the scalar variables.
	- Arrays can be of two types. The static and the dynamic array.
	- In the static array, the size of the array is known beforehand and therefore it is created inside the stack section of the memory.
	- Whereas in the dynamic array the size of the array is not known beforehand and therefore it is created in the heap section of the memory.
	- [[What I Learned]]
		- The main memory contains 3. Sections. The first is the code execution section, the second is the Stack section and the third is the heap section.
		- Program cannot access the heap memory directly.
		- Every variable that is created is created inside the stack section.
	- Abstract Data Type (ADT) Array
		- Abstract data type means the representation of the data as well as some operations on that data.
		- The operations include display, add, append, insert, delete, search, get, SET Max, Min. Reverse, shift, rotate.
- ## Queues
	- What are the applications of queue data structure?
		- It is useful when a resource is shared among multiple consumers.
		- When data is transferred asynchronously.
		- It is also used for load balancing.
- ## MCQs
	- Best time complexity in a worst case scenario of a Sorting algorithm
		- Merge Sort O(n*logn)
