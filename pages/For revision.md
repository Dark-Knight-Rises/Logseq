- ## bus
	- every node is connected with a single cable ka bus
	- if the bus gets damaged the entire system fails
	- used when small no. of devices are to be connected
- ## ring
	- every node is connected with two other nodes
	- if one system fails the entire network fails
- ## star
	- most commonly used
	- every node is connected with a single central system
	- if one system fails, it has no effect on the overall network
	- if the central system fails the entire network fails.
- ## tree
	- combination of two topologies star and bus
	- every star topology is called a segment
	- each segments are connected with a single bus
	- if a segment fails no effect on the overall system
	- if the main bus gets damaged then the system suffers.

- ## hybrid
	- combination of two or more topologies
	- provides flexibility
- ## mesh
	- every node is connected with every other node entirelly
	- very expensive due to the cable cost
	- 2 types
		- partially connected
		- fully connected
