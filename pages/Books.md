- ## Title : Deep Work
	- ### Author : Cal Newport

		- "If you don't produce, you won't thrive --- no matter how skilled or talented you are"
	- ### Summary
		- The book proposes that we have lost our ability to focus deeply and immerse ourselves in a complex task
		- The ability to focus is now less than a goldfish i.e. 8 seconds.
		- Deep Work suggests that being able to completely immerse yourself in a complex task is a rare, valuable and meaningful skill.
	- ### Three Key Lessons
		- Lesson 1
			- Use one of these four deep work strategies, but be intentional about it.
				- The monastic approach. It means shutting yourself off completely, for example by moving to a cabin in the woods to write a novel, and not come back until it’s finished.
				- The bimodal approach. This prioritizes deep work above everything else. You could set a 4-6 hour block each day for deep work.
				- The rhythmic approach. This chunks down your work into time blocks, similar to the Pomodoro technique, and uses a calendar to track your progress.
				- The journalistic approach. If you have a busy daily routine, this works well. What you do is to simply dedicate any, unexpected free time to deep work.
		- Lesson 2
			- Make the most of unproductive time with productive meditation.
			- For example, if you’re taking the subway to work each morning, and know you have 30 minutes to and from work, in which you can’t do much else, use this time to try solving a complex problem in your mind.
		- Lesson 3
			- Quit work at the same time each day, and stick to it.
